# CSRF UI Components Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated all UI components to send CSRF tokens with their API requests. This completes the CSRF protection implementation across the entire application.

## Components Updated

### Inventory Management (4 components) ✅
1. **`/components/inventory/stock-in-dialog.tsx`**
   - POST to `/api/inventory/stock-in`
   - Added CSRF token to headers

2. **`/components/inventory/quick-adjust-dialog.tsx`**
   - POST to `/api/inventory/adjust`
   - Added CSRF token to headers

3. **`/components/workbench/complete-order-dialog.tsx`**
   - POST to `/api/inventory/deduct-simple`
   - Added CSRF token to headers

4. **`/app/(app)/journal/page.tsx`**
   - POST to `/api/inventory/batch-adjust`
   - Added CSRF token to headers

### Product Management (3 components) ✅
1. **`/components/products/create-product-dialog.tsx`**
   - POST to `/api/products`
   - Added CSRF token to headers
   - Also updated locations fetch

2. **`/components/products/edit-product-dialog.tsx`**
   - PUT to `/api/products/[id]`
   - Added CSRF token to headers

3. **`/hooks/use-products.ts`**
   - All mutations (create, update, delete)
   - Added CSRF token to all fetch calls

### Admin Components (3 components) ✅
1. **`/app/(app)/admin/users/page.tsx`**
   - All user management operations
   - Added CSRF token to 6 different API calls

2. **`/app/(app)/admin/settings/page.tsx`**
   - Location creation and deletion
   - Added CSRF token to both operations

3. **`/app/(app)/account/page.tsx`**
   - Password change, location update, preferences
   - Added CSRF token to all PATCH requests

## Implementation Pattern
All components now follow this pattern:
```typescript
import { useCSRF, withCSRFHeaders } from '@/hooks/use-csrf';

// In component
const { token: csrfToken } = useCSRF();

// In fetch call
headers: withCSRFHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, csrfToken),
```

## Security Benefits
- All state-changing operations now include CSRF tokens
- Protection against cross-site request forgery attacks
- Consistent implementation across the entire application
- Automatic token management via the useCSRF hook

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all forms and ensure they still submit successfully
2. Monitor for any 403 errors in the console
3. Verify CSRF tokens are included in request headers
4. Test token refresh on long-running sessions

## Complete Protection
The application now has comprehensive CSRF protection:
- ✅ Backend routes validate CSRF tokens
- ✅ Frontend components send CSRF tokens
- ✅ Token generation and validation infrastructure
- ✅ Error handling for invalid tokens
