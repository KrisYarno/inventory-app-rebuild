# CSRF Protection Status Report

## Current Status

### ✅ CSRF Protection Re-enabled
- `/api/admin/inventory/mass-update` - POST method now validates CSRF tokens

### ⚠️ Routes Missing CSRF Protection

#### Admin Routes (HIGH PRIORITY)
- [ ] `/api/admin/users/[userId]` - DELETE
- [ ] `/api/admin/users/[userId]/approve` - POST
- [ ] `/api/admin/users/[userId]/toggle-admin` - POST
- [ ] `/api/admin/locations/[id]` - DELETE
- [ ] `/api/admin/locations` - POST
- [ ] `/api/admin/products/thresholds` - PATCH

#### Product Management Routes
- [ ] `/api/products/[id]` - PUT, DELETE
- [ ] `/api/products` - POST

#### Inventory Routes
- [ ] `/api/inventory/adjust` - POST
- [ ] `/api/inventory/stock-in` - POST
- [ ] `/api/inventory/deduct` - POST
- [ ] `/api/inventory/deduct-simple` - POST

#### Account Routes
- [ ] `/api/account/password` - PATCH

## Security Risk
Without CSRF protection, these endpoints are vulnerable to:
- Cross-site request forgery attacks
- Unauthorized state changes via malicious websites
- Admin privilege escalation
- Data manipulation

## Implementation Plan
1. Import `validateCSRFToken` from `@/lib/csrf` in each route
2. Add CSRF validation before processing requests
3. Return 403 Forbidden if validation fails
4. Ensure all UI components send CSRF tokens with requests

## Next Steps
Would you like me to:
1. Add CSRF protection to all these routes immediately?
2. Start with the highest risk admin routes first?
3. Create a utility wrapper to simplify CSRF protection across all routes?
