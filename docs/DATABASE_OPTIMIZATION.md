# Database Connection Pool Optimization

## Issue
The mass inventory update feature was experiencing connection pool exhaustion errors:
```
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool. 
More info: http://pris.ly/d/connection-pool (Current connection pool timeout: 10, connection limit: 9)
```

## Root Causes
1. **Low Connection Limit**: Default connection pool limit of 9 is too low for production
2. **Multiple Simultaneous Requests**: Component was making duplicate API calls
3. **Unnecessary Data Refetching**: After save operations, entire dataset was refetched
4. **No Request Deduplication**: No mechanism to cancel in-flight requests

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Client-Side Optimizations
- Added `AbortController` to cancel duplicate requests
- Implemented optimistic updates instead of refetching after save
- Fixed reset function to update local state instead of refetching
- Added proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks

### 2. Database Connection Pool Configuration
For production deployment, add these parameters to your DATABASE_URL:

```env
# Example for MySQL/Railway
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host:port/database?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=20"

# Parameters explained:
# connection_limit=20  - Increase from default 9 to 20 connections
# pool_timeout=20      - Timeout for acquiring connection (in seconds)
```

### 3. Additional Recommendations

#### For Railway/MySQL:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@viaduct.proxy.rlwy.net:55728/railway?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=20&connect_timeout=30"
```

#### For PostgreSQL:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database?connection_limit=20&pool_timeout=20&statement_timeout=30000"
```

#### For PlanetScale:
```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@host/database?ssl={"rejectUnauthorized":true}&connection_limit=20"
```

## Monitoring
Monitor your connection pool usage with these queries:

### MySQL:
```sql
-- Check current connections
SHOW PROCESSLIST;

-- Check max connections setting
SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'max_connections';
```

### PostgreSQL:
```sql
-- Check current connections
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;

-- Check max connections
SHOW max_connections;
```

## Best Practices
1. **Use Connection Pooling**: Always configure appropriate pool sizes
2. **Avoid N+1 Queries**: Use includes/joins to reduce database roundtrips
3. **Implement Request Deduplication**: Cancel duplicate in-flight requests
4. **Use Optimistic Updates**: Update UI immediately, sync with server asynchronously
5. **Monitor Query Performance**: Use Prisma's query logging in development

## Environment-Specific Settings

### Development:
- Lower connection limit (5-10) is usually sufficient
- Enable query logging for debugging

### Production:
- Higher connection limit (20-50) based on traffic
- Disable query logging for performance
- Monitor connection pool metrics

## Troubleshooting

If you still experience connection pool issues:

1. **Check Database Limits**: Ensure your database plan supports the connection limit
2. **Review Long-Running Queries**: Use query monitoring to identify slow queries
3. **Implement Caching**: Add Redis or in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
4. **Use Read Replicas**: Distribute read queries across multiple databases
5. **Implement Query Batching**: Group multiple queries into single transactions
